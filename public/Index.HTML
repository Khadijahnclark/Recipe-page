            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
                    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Add fillings(optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle,
                    sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omlette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Fold and serve:</span> As the omlette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
